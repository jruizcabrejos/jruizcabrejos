### print("Hello World")

At the time of writing, my web(site) opens with an ominous message:

{{% callout %}}
"This “personal” website has been changed and rebuilt several times over the past few years. Hopefully, this is the last one?"
{{% /callout %}}

And while I do hope this is the last time I am rebuilding this website, I have to admit that I suffer from a 'lack of documentation' problem. Don't get me wrong, though:

Everything I have done in the context of "academic" projects has been meticulously documented and every step is detailed somewhere. Where possible, papers and methods are publicly available and open-source. If you don't know what the [FAIR Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) are, don't talk to me, etc.

I also have the tendency to hoard and take note of every little idea, draft or file that was generated through the ✨process✨just in case we have to 'take a look back' and reflect on it in the future.

I am also a big fan of using diagrams to describe stuff in general.

My documentation problem comes down to my "personal"<sup>("pet"?)</sup> projects. Over the years I have written code in R for several tools to process, scrap, or extract data. I have generated data visualizations (most terrible, some great) that are located *somewhere* in the many virtual files I possess, but none of it has been publicly posted anywhere.

Some fragments of code lost to time are not impressive (or at least I would not call them as such), but I always think of them whenever I am asked for examples of previous work I have done.

Have I done some very complex Shiny apps? Yes. Do I have a Shiny app I can share with the class? No :(.

The ✨data collection process✨ to extract price data from a combination of unstructured texts, tables, and images in Discord chat servers for a World of Warcraft: Classic community took me about a dozen hours to refine.

All I have to show for it is a very simple graphic which I actually really like (the graphic does tell a story, for those who are a bit more familiar with its contents), but in retrospective it falls short when trying to convey the technical aspects behind the data collected.

Can I process unstructured chat data containing multiple types of data? Yeah. Can I explain to you how I did it?

Uh, kind of? Let me open the code I did 8 years ago.

Only items sold are considered. Original dataset contains 316 unique items and 10,747 data points. </figcaption>

This "personal" website is one of those "personal projects" that at some point existed, got abandoned, and had to be rebuilt over and over again, due to a lack of maintenance.

I took the `jruizcabrejos` 'nickname' around 2015, and bought the .com domain at some point in 2018, shortly after having the talk with my supervisor about which 'scholar/academic' name should I choose for my (first) publication(s).

It is almost like choosing an appropriate username for a MMORPG videogame. Would you rather be known as the level 50 Warrior named `Save`? (one word, simple, elegant) Or as the level 50 Warrior known as `XxAnimeManga01xX`? (many words, unhinged, based).

In my case, "Jorge Ruiz" is fairly common and I would like to keep my mother surname, so I ended up using "Jorge Ruiz-Cabrejos" or jruizcabrejos / J. Ruiz-Cabrejos for most things.

### Actually, it's "Hello, World!"

These posts are a good excuse for me to document my personal projects and publish somewhere all the "waste code" that I generate along the way, starting with this website.

Finding the figures above (Fig.1, Fig.2 and Fig.3) took me longer than it took to write this post. So I guess it is more of an ’indexing’ problem and not so much a ’lack of documentation’ problem what I have.
