summary: This study in low transmission areas of Loreto, Peru, examines the relationship between malaria exposure and proximity to health facilities. Findings show significant seropositivity rates for P. falciparum and P. vivax, with higher exposure in villages farther from healthcare centers, and identified spatial hotspots.
