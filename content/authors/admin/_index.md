    I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

  summary: |
    Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

This “personal” website has been changed and rebuild several times over the past few years. Hopefully this is the last one?

My name is Jorge, and currently I am a PhD student researching the impacts of human-induced climate change on population health.

Health data scientist with experience on infectious diseases, maternal health and healthcare management. Most of my work is focused on the analysis and validation of data collection methods for healthcare research, as well as exploiting novel data sources.


Currently at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGLOBAL) with Joan Ballester (Early-Adapt group) and the Institute of Tropical Medicine Alexander von Humboldt (IMTAvH) with Gabriel Carrasco-Escobar (Innovalab).
